# versions

* 0.0.1 - d4410334

* 0.1.0 - 93b5c26e
    1. add log
    2. multiple databases to reduce clash

* 0.1.1 - e60e3b87
    1. replace std hashmap with dashmap

* 0.2.0 - 2855381b
    1. implement and tested expiration.
    2. rewrite error handling with anyhow.
    3. change key from String to Bytes.
    4. replace dashmap with forked version.
    
    0.2.0 has a pretty good small packet performance, large packet performance is bad though. There isn't a secret sauce in it - it reduces contention by having tons of hashmaps. It's the last version based on Mutex.

* 0.3.0 - e819202b
    1. change concurreny model from `shared state workers` to `actor`, significantly improve large packet performance.

* 0.3.1 - 87939e58
    1. changed channel mechanism
    
    This commit, however, is not guaranteed to be positive. It's beneficial in `Theory` but I didn't test it thoroughly.

* 0.4.0 - 5798ece2
    1. object pool (for handler).
    2. refactor shutdown mechanism.
    3. rewrite encoder to improve get performance.
    4. rewrite arg parsing.

* 0.4.1 - 9f6600e8
    1. rewrite read by implementing `intermediate token parsing`. 

    This improvement is introduced by `Flamegraph`. Through which I found that `get_line` in decoding is the bottleneck.

* 0.4.2 - 9d3e4a8e
    1. implemented debug: key_num, total_key_len, total_val_len
    2. implement debug - random_keys
    3. implement list as a return type from database.
    4. remove some unused dependencies.

* 0.4.3 - 4614af16
    1. vectored write, further reducing copy and improving get performance.
    2. use jemalloc to improve performance.
    3. use unbounded mpsc channel to send task.
    4. use oneshot channel to collect results:
        simplifing code and improve performance.
    5. refactor debug command.
