## Overview

The project starts as a fork of [mini-redis](https://github.com/tokio-rs/mini-redis), and then evolves into a lockless actor based design iteratively. The removal of explicit use of Mutex results in better throughput. It can achieve similar or slightly better performance to the original [Redis](https://redis.io/) on x86 Linux, and slightly worse performance on AArch64 machines, partly due to Rust not providing SwissTable on these platforms. When it comes to multiple operations (e.g., mset, mget), there's a significant performance gain for our implementation.
